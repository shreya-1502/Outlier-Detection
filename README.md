# Outlier-Detection
Outliers can arise for various reasons, such as measurement errors, experimental errors, or genuine rare events. Identifying and handling outliers is important in data preprocessing and analysis to ensure that statistical models are not unduly influenced by these extreme values.
Here's a brief overview of how outliers are often identified and handled in Python:
Identifying Outliers:
1) Visual Inspection: Plotting the data using graphs such as box plots, histograms, or scatter plots can help visually identify outliers.
2) Statistical Methods: Various statistical methods can be employed to detect outliers, such as Z-score or IQR (Interquartile Range) method.

# Z_score
In statistics, the Z-score (or standard score) is a measure that quantifies how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a dataset. It's commonly used to identify outliers in a dataset by flagging observations that deviate significantly from the mean.
The Z-score for a data point x in a dataset with mean μ and standard deviation σ is calculated using the following formula:
Z= (x−μ) / σ
